Blacklist Radeon Driver

If you are using an AMD graphics card, the radeon driver might be causing issues as it does not support newer versions of Ubuntu. The amdgpu driver that comes with the kernel does however. To blacklist the radeon driver and ensure amdgpu is loaded:

Open /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf for editing and add blacklist radeon to the file. Then run:

sudo update-initramfs -c -k all
sudo shutdown -r now
